# World Happiness Data 2024 - Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the 2024 World Happiness Report data. The dataset explores various indicators contributing to happiness and well-being across different countries, such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Dataset
**Source**: The dataset used in this analysis is based on the World Happiness Report 2024, which includes 2363 entries with the following key columns:

- `Country name`: Name of the country.
- `year`: Year of data collection.
- `Life Ladder`: Average self-reported life evaluation.
- `Log GDP per capita`: Log-transformed GDP per capita.
- `Social support`: The average of binary responses (0 or 1) indicating whether individuals have someone to count on.
- `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in good health.
- `Freedom to make life choices`: The degree to which individuals feel free to make life decisions.
- `Generosity`: Measure of charitable behavior in society.
- `Perceptions of corruption`: Indicator of perceived corruption.
- `Positive affect`: Frequency of positive emotions experienced.
- `Negative affect`: Frequency of negative emotions experienced.

## Key Objectives
- **Analyze** the distribution and trends of happiness scores and other indicators over time.
- **Identify correlations** between variables to understand their impact on overall happiness.
- **Create visualizations** to highlight significant insights and relationships within the data.

## Notable Insights
- **Correlations**: Initial analysis revealed positive correlations between `Log GDP per capita` and `Life Ladder`, as well as significant relationships between `Social support`, `Healthy life expectancy`, and reported happiness.
- **Trends**: Countries with higher freedom of choice and lower perceptions of corruption tend to report higher happiness scores.
- **Visualizations**: The project includes various charts and graphs generated using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use the Project

## Example Visualizations
This analysis includes visual representations such as:
- Scatter plots showing the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores.
- Box plots comparing regional variations in key happiness indicators.
- Heatmaps for visualizing correlations between multiple variables.

## Results and Conclusions
